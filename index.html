										<h2>About</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Ever since I can remember I was passionate about technology, from taking apart my father's working radio to see what’s inside of it and how it works (only one of us was happy when that happened), to building desktop units for my friends.
									One of the best jobs I had as a teenager was working as a network administrator at an internet caffe, where, besides serving customers, we had to solve hardware and software issues.</p>
									<p>The first time I interacted with coding was before joining Business Academy Aarhus and my only regret is not starting it sooner. I love coding and the incredible amount of things you can do in this day and age with different programming languages, every time I solve something that took me maybe hours to figure out I feel a wave of happiness and excitement.
									As a new programmer I might not have the experience but for sure I have the energy and the willingness to learn and overcome obstacles.</p>

									<h3>Things I Can Do</h3>
									<p>I was never one that looked at the great sea of the unknown and didn’t jump in for a quick swim. This stands true in my personal and professional life, and this way of thinking reflects now on my personality since I am somewhat of a Jack off all trades. One thing that I can say confidently about myself is that no matter where I land and in what circumstances, I can get myself home. </p>

									<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>These are some example projects that I really enjoyed working at:</p>
									<div class="features">

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/tank.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>RoboCar</h4>
												<h7>The goal of this project was to make a car that will perform a few tasks:</h7>
												<ol>
													<li>Follow a '8' shapped black tape track (autonomous)</li>
													<li>Push a few boxes from a circle without leaving the circle (autonomous)</li>
													<li>Play football (app controlled)</li>
												</ol>
												<h5>How was that achieved:</h5>
												<ul>
													<li>the car was created using 3D printing and the desing was made using Tinkercad</li>
													<li>the main component was Raspberry Pi that was coded using Python</li>
													<li>the tasks were achieved using proximity and light sensors</li>
												</ul>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Chess LED display</h4>
												<p>The purpose of this was to make a chess timer from an LED display that was coded using C#</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Electric bike tracker</h4>
												<p>This IOT device was created using an antenna, a microcontroller, a GPS module and a Raspberry Pi. The GPS-enabled device creates a payload of data and transmits it 
													through the antenna to a nearby LoRa Node, which is then transferred to the LoRa servers. The location can be viewed on a web page that will show the position of
													the bike in the last 24hours.</p>
